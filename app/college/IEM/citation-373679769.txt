Hasan, Md. Sakib. (2023). Determination of Tensile Strength of a given specimen using UTM (25KN). The determination of tensile strength involves testing a given specimen using a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) with a capacity of 25 kilonewtons (25KN). This process assesses the specimen's ability to withstand tensile (pulling) forces until it reaches its breaking point. The UTM applies a gradually increasing load to the specimen, recording the corresponding deformation or extension until failure occurs. Tensile strength is then calculated by dividing the maximum force applied by the original cross-sectional area of the specimen. This critical data is essential in evaluating the material's mechanical properties and suitability for various applications, such as engineering, manufacturing, and construction.
